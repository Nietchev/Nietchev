       Beerly : an App for beer recommendation, with an unsupervised and a collaborative recommendation system.

    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
        Rust, because sometimes you just have to compile
        Sparks, AWS 

    ðŸš€ my road map:
        1. Rework old code .... gasp
        2. Switch to Rust for more complex project (see 1)
        3. Code a transformer because the results are impressive and why not !
        4. Not sure after the data science bootcamps, what inspiration I will get and which path I will move on...

    ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with almost everthing I don't understand, and a job
